# difftrainer-dictfiles
### default dictionaries and language configs for DiffTrainer(not implemented yet)

##About
These are meant to be minimal, phoneme only dictionary sets for use in DiffTrainer after the upcoming multi-dictionary DiffSinger update.
merged.yaml(name may change) is meant to contain only the most basic, universally agreed upon cross-language phoneme merges.
