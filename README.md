# difftrainer-dictfiles
### default dictionaries and language configs for DiffTrainer

## About
These are meant to be minimal, phoneme only dictionary sets for use in DiffTrainer after the upcoming multi-dictionary DiffSinger update.
merged.yaml(name may change) is meant to contain only some basic, universally agreed upon cross-language phoneme merges, primarily as a formatting reference.
